This document describes the criteria for Certification Acceptance. The features for acceptance of the rendered image is described for each model.

This document is used by the Certification Review Team to guide their evaluation of a submitted set of rendered images to determine if the results are certified. This document is part of the Certification Program1 and knowledge and action of that Program is assumed.
This document is (c) 2021, Khronos Group. Usage and license details are at the end of the document.

[[introduction]]
= Introduction
This document is to guide the evaluators of 3D Commerce certification submissions when determining if a submission meets the criteria for certification. It should be used by certificants to ensure their submissions meet all of these requirements. All submissions must meet all criteria specified in this document except where a specific exception is documented and accepted. A submission may be rejected for reasons not included here. Those rejections will be well-documented and can be appealed to the 3D Commerce Working Group.
The general rendered image requirements are described. These are taken directly from the Test Plan document (*link tbd*) and those are considered authoritative. The minimal acceptance criteria is described for each model separately. The models are designed to test a breadth of rendering capabilities.

[[rendered-inmage-requirements]]
= Rendered Image Requirements
The Certification Program Test Plan document defines the detailed requirements for generating the certification images. This is done in Section 4. Unless otherwise specified, all models are lit with a neutral image-base-light (IBL) and are displayed against a uniform white background. All certification images must be 1024x1024 and displayed according to the embedded cameras. The five retail models have three cameras each. One of the analytical models (spheres) is displayed in four different IBLs. All certification images need to be created according to the rules specified in the Test Plan document.

Certification renders will be evaluated programmatically and through human checks. When scored by the _evaluation_ tool inluded in the repository an SSIM of lower than _**X**_ and/or a PSNR of lower than _**X**_ will automatically flag the image for review. While these image evaluations are primarily to guide the Certifiers in their manual evaluations, it is likely that images which receive scores at or below the provided threshold will fail Certification. You may consider using the tool prior to submission and making changes if an image falls below the threshold.

Some common issues which cause failures include lighting discrepancies, problems with transparency, and clamps on roughness values.

[[models-criteria]]
= Models Criteria
Each model is separately listed with a discussion of the criteria for certification for each.

[[analytical-test-objects]]
== Analytical Test Objects
Evaluation Criteria: Analytical test object renders will be evaluated for color parity and material behavior. The Render Creation Document includes information and recommendations for calibration. A maximum of 5% deviation from Reference Renders sRGB pixel values is allowed. Additionally the behavior of metallic and roughness values on the two bottom rows of sphere and cube objects should display similarly, exhibiting the expected PBR material qualities and representing the full range of roughness from not at all to fully rough.

[[analytical-spheres]]

[[mixer]]
== Mixer

.Mixer Full View
image:../models/Mixer/rr-Mixer-0.png[pdfwidth=7in,align-left]

_Mixer model in full view. This is the view from camera0._

[[mixer-criteria]]
=== Mixer - Criteria
* The Mixer should be using a PBR Metallic Roughness material to ensure the materials appear correct.
* Since most of this model is metallic, it’s important that the material be correct in order to get the highlights just right.
* Micro Details: This model has very subtle imperfections that make it easy to miss from afar but when rendered, those details help to showcase what type of material is being used, Metal, Hard Plastic, etc.

[[mixer-metallic]]
=== Mixer - Metallic
* Material Accuracy: When moving the environment around the model, you’ll notice areas that catch light and that the environment reflected in the metal pieces are more apparent. These hotspots and clearer reflections help determine the right level of metalness needed.
* Reflections: Another way to see if the metalness is correct, is to see how much of the environment can be reflected. The front knob and mixer blade, are more reflective than the bowl and the band going around the mixer.

[[shoe]]
== Shoe

.Shoe Full View
image:../models/Shoe/rr-Shoe-0.png[pdfwidth=7in,align-left]

_Shoe model in full view. This is the view from camera0._

[[shoe-criteria]]
=== Shoe - Criteria
* The shoe should be using a PBR Metallic Roughness material to ensure the materials on the shoe appear correct
* The top of the shoe is using a mesh like material with a normal map that creates the appearance of indentations
* The sole of the shoe uses the normal map in the opposite direction to create a ripple or bubble like effect to help denote that it is foam.
* Inside the shoe, there is a subtle bumping to help emphasize the more felt like material.
* All of the pieces have a subtle change in roughness and metalness but this is more obvious in the laces. The laces have a sheen on them that catch light.

[[shoe-normal-map]]
=== Shoe - Normal Map
* Small indents for the mesh as well as pebbling on the foam sole help to create nuance in materials that are all soft

.Shoe Sidewall Detail

_Shoe model showing the sole and side in detail. This is the view from camera1._

[[shoe-metal-roughness]]
=== Shoe - Metal + Roughness
* The subtle changes in the different materials used help to make it obvious what the different panels of the shoe are made of. The Roughness and Metal changes also help to make the different versions of black more obvious as well.

.Shoe Laces and Tounge

_Full view of the wicker chair from camera0. The back is modeled and textured using alpha transparency._

[[wicker-chair-criteria]]
=== WickerChair - Criteria
* WickerChair should show Alpha Coverage transparency in Blend mode, for the fine curvy wicker pattern.
* Depth sorting should be correct; the inside of the chair should be rendered before the outside.
* Normal map for the cushion should show correct shading. See screenshots below.

[[wicker-chair-transparency]]
=== WickerChair - Transparency
The curvy wicker texture should use alpha-as-coverage in Alpha Blend mode, and should show correct depth sorting.

.Chair Wicker Close-Up
image:../models/WickerChair/rr-WickerChair-1.png[pdfwidth=7in,align-left]

_Camera 1 shows correct depth sorting. The larger curvy texture on the outside surface should render in front of the smaller texture on the inside surface._

The correct transparency mode is BLEND which shows soft edges (above). The incorrect transparency mode is MASK which has abrupt hard edges.

[[green-chair]]
== Green Chair

[[green-chair-criteria]]
=== Green Chair - Criteria
* The Green Chair is designed to showcase the KHR_Texture_Transform extension, examples of what this model would look like without this extension enabled - See screenshots below.
* The model should be using a PBR metallic roughness material to ensure the materials appear correct.
* This model has subtle details such as the green and brown fabric using normal maps, these should be seen when previewing the model up-close using the embedded scene cameras.

.Green Chair Full View
image:../models/GreenChair/rr-GreenChair-0.png[pdfwidth=7in,align-left]

_Green chair model in full view. This is the view from camera0._

Using the first camera to get a close-up shot of the model, there should be visible tiling and fine details in the fabric and wood. These details would otherwise be lost without the KHR_Texture_Transform extension enabled.

.Green Chair Texture Transform
image:../models/GreenChair/rr-GreenChair-1.png[pdfwidth=7in,align-left]

_Green chair model showing detail of correct texture transform in the green material and wood grain in chair arm. This is the view from camera1._

Above picture illustrates one of the close-up cameras with the extension enabled or disabled on the model. Important texture fidelity and consistency is lost.

Using the second camera to get a close-up shot of the model, there should be visible tiling and fine details in the fabric and wood. These details would otherwise be lost without the KHR_Texture_Transform extension enabled. The brown fabric should also carry a subtle tiled normal-map texture, enhancing the material appearance of the chair.

.Green Chair Texture Transform
image:../models/GreenChair/rr-GreenChair-2.png[pdfwidth=7in,align-left]

_Green chair model showing another detail of correct texture transform in the green material and wood grain in chair arm. This is the view from camera2._

Above picture illustrates the region under the chair without the transformation extension enabled. When the extension is not working as intended, this area will display a texture transformation several times larger than intended for the brown fabric in particular as seen above.

Using the User camera, the wood-laquer on the armchair should be clearly visible when using the neutral IBL, as a semi-matte finish.
