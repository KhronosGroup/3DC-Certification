## About Certification

### Introduction

The primary reference for the 3D Commerce Certification<sup>TM</sup> is the [Certification Documents](./documents). There is additional material at the [3D Commerce<sup>TM</sup>](https://www.khronos.org/3dcommerce/) page. What follows is supplemental material to help understand where Certification Program operates

### Background

3D commerce models are being used by most of the major retailers and advertiser networks. Retailers and manufactures were concerned that the appearance of models varied over the collection of authorized resellers and advertisers. In co-operation with retailers, resellers, and manufactures; Khronos develop this Certification program to help ensure that products look the same and closely appear like their physical counter-parts.

### Domain

This release of the Certification Program is limited in that it is only concerned about single products in a well-lit neutral background studio stage. This is what you would find in a typical single product studio photo-shoot. There is a large range of lighting and product environments that are not covered in the Certification process. It is anticipated that future versions of the Certification Test Suite will address those considerations. If you have particular skills, experience, or business interest there, we strongly recommend that you consider joining [Khronos Group](https://khronos.org).
